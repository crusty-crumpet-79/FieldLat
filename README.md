# Fea-lattice-gen: FEA-Driven Lattice Generation

A python tool made to generate functionally graded lattice structures from FEA field data such as FEBio.

## Features
 - Converts FEBio Element  data to Nodal data automatically.
 - Maps stress/strain fields to lattice thickness.
 - Exports clean STLs for 3D printing or re-meshing.

## Installation
 ```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
